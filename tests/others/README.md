# Other Test Scripts

This directory contains test scripts that don't fit into the main test categories.

## Files

### Legacy Test Scripts
- `simple_test.py` - Basic connection test script
- `start_bld_remote.py` - Service startup helper script  
- `test_compatibility_fix.py` - Compatibility testing script

### Description
These scripts are primarily for development and debugging purposes. They may not follow the standard test framework patterns but provide useful functionality for manual testing and troubleshooting.

## Usage
Run these scripts directly from the project root:
```bash
pixi run python tests/others/simple_test.py
```

## Note
These scripts may require manual setup or specific Blender configurations to run properly.
