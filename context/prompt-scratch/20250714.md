we checked that modal operator does not work properly, now we change the approach, we will NOT use `bpy.app.timers.register()` to register a function in background mode, instead, we do the following:
- create a background plugin like `blender_addon/bld_remote_mcp/__init__.py`, which pure python class plugin, runs in background mode, and does not depend on Blender's GUI.
- the new plugin still has the same functionality as the `blender_addon/simple-tcp-executor`, but it does not use `bpy.app.timers.register()` to register a function, instead, it uses a simple TCP server to listen for commands, and execute them in Blender's context. To do so, it has a `step()` method, which is called periodically by the main thread, and it will pull commands from the queue and just execute them, without worrying about which thread is running the code, let the outer layer handle the threading issues.
- when `step()` is called, it will just pull all commands from the queue, and execute them one by one. When the callables are pushed into queue, they are pushed with a callback function, which will be called when the command is finished, with the result of the command. The original socket handling thread will wait fo this callback (probably it encapsulates some thread synchronization mechanism), and return the result to the client.

Before we go with this approach, we backup the current implementation of `simple-tcp-executor` by copying its `__init__.py` into `as_modal_operator.py`, and then we will implement the new plugin in `blender_addon/simple-tcp-executor/__init__.py`.

---

we now need to find out the pattern of how to execute code in Blender's context, and return the result back to the client, in both GUI mode and background mode, using modal operator and manages event loop, first let's try the `blender_addon/simple-tcp-executor`, install it to the blender and see if works. Note that this plugin does not directly work with `blender-remote-cli.py`, you need to extend it a bit, adding a `debug` subcommand:
- `debug install`, install the debug plugin to Blender, which is `blender_addon/simple-tcp-executor`
- `debug start`, start the debug plugin, in GUI mode
- `debug start --background`, start the debug plugin, in background mode, this will run Blender in background mode, and keep it alive, so that you can connect to it later.
- `debug start --port=xxx`, start the debug plugin, in background mode, and listen on the specified port, default to 7777, if not set, read from env variable `BLD_DEBUG_TCP_PORT`, if not set, use 7777 as default.

And then, we try to see if we can execute some code in Blender's context, and return the result back to the client, in both GUI mode and background mode. The code should be a valid Python code that can be executed in Blender's context, and return a result that can be serialized to JSON.

based on such modal operator, as well as bpy.app.timers (https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.app.timers.html), create a plugin with this pattern
- at start, it creates a thread, listening to port 7777, using tcp socket
- when something comes in, it collects everything, which makes up a string that is a valid python code. It then creates a callable with that string, along with a structure that can be used to wait for the result, and then it waits for the result by blocking.
- the plugin is a modal operator, it will run in its main event loop, and it will pull from the queue, get a callable, and then call it. The callable will execute the code in Blender's context, and return the result. The result will be put into the structure that can be used to wait for the result, and then the plugin will continue to run.
- in the tcp thread, it then gets the result from the structure, and sends it back to the client.

name this plugin as `simple-tcp-executor`, and save it to `blender_addon/simple-tcp-executor/__init__.py`.

the 7777 port is not flexible, read it from env variable `BLD_DEBUG_TCP_PORT`, if not set, use 7777 as default.

---

Make sure the basic client class (`src/blender_remote/client.py`) works properly, and then focus on testing `get_object_as_glb()` in `BlenderSceneManager` (`src/blender_remote/scene_manager.py`), this method is used to get an object as a glTF binary stream, and transmitted to `BlenderClientAPI` (`src/blender_remote/client.py`), check out `context/hints/blender-api-ref` for details about the related Blender API, and make sure the method works as expected.

we have successfully implemented the MCP server using `uvx blender-remote` and `BLD_Remote_MCP` addon, which is a drop-in replacement for `uvx blender-mcp` and `BlenderAutoMCP`. Now we move on to the remote control via Python API, which is `src/blender_remote/client.py` and `src/blender_remote/scene_manager.py`, these classes are used to control Blender remotely via Python API, and they communicate directly with the `BLD_Remote_MCP` addon, circumventing the MCP server (`uvx blender-remote`). This is useful for advanced users who want to control Blender directly without going through the MCP server, sometimes even calling `BLD_Remote_MCP` methods that are not exposed by the MCP server due to protocol limitations. Now devise a test plan for these classes, save to `context/plans/blender-remote-client-test-plan.md`, and make sure to cover all the methods in these classes. For tempororary stuff, you can save to `<workspace>/tmp`, create a subdir for the test. The test scripts should be saved to `context/tests` with appropriate names, and the test results should be saved to `context/logs/tests` with appropriate names. If any issue is left out during the test, create a task in `context/tasks/todo` subdir with appropriate name and description, and link it to the test script and result log. 

Note that those remote control classes are somewhat outdated, so you can modify them according to your needs, but make sure to keep the original functionality.

Note that if anything goes wrong, you can use `blender-mcp` as a backup communication method, see `context/plans/mcp-server-comprehensive-test-plan.md` for details, this will allow you execute some blender code for verification. Because `uvx blender-remote` is a drop-in replacement for `uvx blender-mcp`, you can also use it as backup communication method.

Note that those remote control classes were tested before with `blender-mcp`, so their core logic should work, problems should typically arise in input/output handling, so you can focus on those parts.

TODO:
restructure the `src/blender_remote` directory
- move `mcp_server.py` to a subdir named `mcp`, and break the file into smaller files, so that it is easier to maintain and understand. 
- move things related to `blender-remote-cli` to a subdir named `cli`, and break the file into smaller files, so that it is easier to maintain and understand.
- move things related to remote control via python api to a subdir named `remote`, and maintain the file as it is, DO NOT break them yet.

scan the workspace to find out what should be updated with the new structure, and update them accordingly.

as you find out, complex code will easily introduce formatting issues, so, to avoid this, we will allow the `mcp_server.py` to transmit the code as a base64-encoded string, and then decode it in the `BLD_Remote_MCP` addon, so that it can be executed in Blender's context. This way, we can avoid formatting issues and still run the code as expected. 

To do this, you will need to modify the `mcp_server.py`, add an argument to the `execute_code` method, name it `send_as_base64:bool`, default to `False`, and if it is `True`, then encode the code as base64 before sending it to Blender. In the `BLD_Remote_MCP` addon, you will need to find out that the code is base64-encoded (maybe adding a new flag to json params), and decode it before executing it in Blender's context.

Formatting issue may also happen when the result is a complex object, so, to avoid this, we will also allow the `mcp_server.py` to instruct the `BLD_Remote_MCP` addon to return the result as a base64-encoded string, and then decode it in the `mcp_server.py` before returning it to the client. This way, we can avoid formatting issues and still return the result as expected. To do this, we will add an argument to the `execute_code` method, name it `return_as_base64:bool`, default to `False`, and if it is `True`, then encode the result as base64 before returning it to the client. In the `BLD_Remote_MCP` addon, you will need to find out that the result is base64-encoded (maybe adding a new flag to json params), and decode it before returning it to the client.

Note that, `execute_code` method should be backward compatible, so, if the `send_as_base64` and `return_as_base64` arguments are not provided, it should behave as before, i.e. not encode the code and result as base64.

---
one import thing to test is that, the mcp server (`uvx blender-remote` + `BLD_Remote_MCP`) should be able to run the given blender code and get back the result in the synchronous way, i.e. you send a request to MCP server, it runs the code in Blender, and returns the result back to you. The result expected is defined in the given blender code, which is a Python script that runs in Blender's context, and customzable instead of just something like "code executed successfully". For example, you can try to create some objects in Blender, and get back their vertices global coordinates, or something like that. Include this in your test plan.

about how to keep blender alive in background, see `blender-remote-cli` command implemented in `src/blender_remote/cli.py`, it creates startup script to keep Blender alive in background.

----

in the test plan, note these:
- you will use `pixi` to run python scripts
- you shall write test logs to `context/logs/tests` subdir, to keep a memo about what you did and what happens, be concise, just some critical info.

note that, our tools is drop-in replacement for BlenderAutoMCP, this means:
- `uvx blender-remote` combined with `BLD_Remote_MCP` is a drop-in replacement for `uvx blender-mcp` combined with `BlenderAutoMCP`, not one-on-one replacement, but replacement as combinations. So, do not try to just replace one of them, it is not supposed to work.
- for combinations, if you input something to `BlenderAutoMCP` and get back result, the result should be the same as if you input the same to `uvx blender-remote` and get back result from `BLD_Remote_MCP`. Not exactly the same, but functionally equivalent, we can have more info and features, but the result should be the same in terms of what it does.

finally, replace those graphviz diagrams with the ones generated by `dot` command, and put them in `context/plans/graphics` subdir, and link them here, use .svg format.

note that, for `blender-mcp`, we have NO control over which port it uses (as MCP server), you can inspect `context/refcode/blender_auto_mcp/server.py` to find out its internal logic. To change http port, we can only change our MCP server port, which is `uvx blender-remote --mcp-port xxxx`, and it will use that port to listen for MCP requests, and then forward them to Blender's MCP server, which is `BLD_Remote_MCP` addon.

## Tools
you have these tools available:
- `jq`, a command-line JSON processor
- `httpie`, a command-line HTTP client, for testing HTTP APIs, already installed
- `dot`, graphviz command-line tool, for generating diagrams from .dot files
