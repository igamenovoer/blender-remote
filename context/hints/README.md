# Hints

This directory contains programming hints and tutorials collected from various sources.

## Purpose

- Store useful programming tutorials and guides
- Collect best practices for specific tasks
- Document solutions to common problems
- Provide quick reference for implementation patterns

## Organization

Hints should be organized by topic:
- Blender API usage examples
- Python packaging best practices
- MCP protocol implementation guides
- Network programming patterns
- Testing strategies

## File Naming

Use descriptive names that indicate the content:
- `blender_api_basics.md`
- `python_async_patterns.md`
- `mcp_protocol_guide.md`

## Usage

When facing a new implementation challenge:
1. Check if relevant hints already exist
2. Apply the documented patterns
3. Add new hints after solving novel problems
