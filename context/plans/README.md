# Plans

This directory contains implementation plans and project roadmaps.

## Purpose

Store planning documents that outline how to build features and organize development work:

- Implementation roadmaps and timelines
- Feature development plans
- Sprint planning and milestone definitions
- Resource allocation and task assignments
- Project phases and deliverable breakdowns
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

## Content Types

### Implementation Plans
- Step-by-step development approaches
- Task breakdowns and dependencies
- Resource requirements and estimates
- Testing and validation strategies

### Project Roadmaps
- Feature prioritization and sequencing
- Release planning and versioning
- Long-term vision and goals
- Integration schedules

### Planning Documents
- Sprint goals and deliverables
- Team coordination plans
- Development workflow definitions
- Quality assurance processes

## File Organization

Use date-based or version-based naming:
- `2024_q1_roadmap.md`
- `feature_x_implementation_plan.md`
- `sprint_planning_template.md`
- `v1_0_release_plan.md`

## Usage

Before starting new development cycles:
1. Review existing plans for context
2. Create implementation plans for major features
3. Break down work into manageable tasks
4. Define success criteria and milestones
5. Update plans as work progresses

Plans should be living documents that evolve as the project progresses and requirements change.
