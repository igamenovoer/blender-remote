## Tool Structure

Each tool should include:
```
tool_name/
├── README.md      # Tool description and usage
├── tool.py        # Main implementation
├── requirements.txt   # Dependencies if any
└── examples/      # Usage examples
```

## Quality Standards

Tools should be:
- Well-documented with clear usage instructions
- Tested with example inputs
- Efficient for token-saving purposes
- General enough for reuse across sessions

## Usage

Before implementing complex logic, check if a relevant tool exists here that can be reused or adapted.
