# This file is for random prompts, temporary stuff

**DO NOT READ THIS FILE UNLESS YOU ARE TOLD TO DO**
**It contains many outdated and temporary information**

in the test plan, note these:
- you will use `pixi` to run python scripts
- you shall write test logs to `context/logs/tests` subdir, to keep a memo about what you did and what happens, be concise, just some critical info.

note that, our tools is drop-in replacement for BlenderAutoMCP, this means:
- `uvx blender-remote` combined with `BLD_Remote_MCP` is a drop-in replacement for `uvx blender-mcp` combined with `BlenderAutoMCP`, not one-on-one replacement, but replacement as combinations. So, do not try to just replace one of them, it is not supposed to work.
- for combinations, if you input something to `BlenderAutoMCP` and get back result, the result should be the same as if you input the same to `uvx blender-remote` and get back result from `BLD_Remote_MCP`. Not exactly the same, but functionally equivalent, we can have more info and features, but the result should be the same in terms of what it does.

finally, replace those graphviz diagrams with the ones generated by `dot` command, and put them in `context/plans/graphics` subdir, and link them here, use .svg format.

note that, for `blender-mcp`, we have NO control over which port it uses (as MCP server), you can inspect `context/refcode/blender_auto_mcp/server.py` to find out its internal logic. To change http port, we can only change our MCP server port, which is `uvx blender-remote --mcp-port xxxx`, and it will use that port to listen for MCP requests, and then forward them to Blender's MCP server, which is `BLD_Remote_MCP` addon.

## Tools
you have these tools available:
- `jq`, a command-line JSON processor
- `httpie`, a command-line HTTP client, for testing HTTP APIs, already installed
- `dot`, graphviz command-line tool, for generating diagrams from .dot files
