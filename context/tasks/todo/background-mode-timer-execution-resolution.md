# Background Mode Timer Execution Resolution Task

**Task ID**: background-mode-timer-execution-resolution  
**Created**: 2025-07-14  
**Priority**: High  
**Type**: Bug Fix / Investigation  
**Status**: In Progress - Solution Implemented, Validation Pending

## Issue Summary

Commands sent to background mode Blender were timing out due to `bpy.app.timers` not executing properly. The root cause was identified as a blocked event loop caused by a monopolizing sleep loop in the keep-alive mechanism.

## Investigation Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - FILES REVERTED FOR CLEAN IMPLEMENTATION

### Root Cause Identified
- **Primary Issue**: `while _keep_running: time.sleep(0.05)` loop blocking event processing
- **Secondary Issue**: Timer-based command execution dependent on blocked event loop
- **Impact**: 100% failure rate for background mode commands

### Solution Implemented (REVERTED)
- ‚èÆÔ∏è **Keep-Alive Fix**: Timer-based approach with minimal event processor (REVERTED)
- ‚èÆÔ∏è **Direct Execution**: Background mode bypasses timer mechanism (REVERTED)  
- ‚èÆÔ∏è **Mode Detection**: Automatic GUI vs background mode handling (REVERTED)

### Files Reverted (2025-07-14)
**Both implementation files have been restored to clean baseline state:**
- **`blender_addon/bld_remote_mcp/__init__.py`**: Reverted to original timer-based execution
- **`src/blender_remote/cli.py`**: Reverted to original problematic `while...sleep` loop

**Purpose**: Enable systematic re-implementation of background mode fix from scratch using investigation insights as guidance.

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
```
src/blender_remote/cli.py:474-578
blender_addon/bld_remote_mcp/__init__.py:260-305
```

### Key Changes
1. **Timer-Based Keep-Alive**: Replaced blocking loop with event-friendly approach
2. **Mode-Specific Execution**: Direct execution for background, timers for GUI
3. **Enhanced Logging**: Better debugging information for troubleshooting

### Testing Approach
```bash
# Background mode testing
pixi run python src/blender_remote/cli.py start --background --port 8000

# Test commands
echo '{"type":"get_scene_info","params":{}}' | nc localhost 8000
echo '{"type":"execute_code","params":{"code":"print(\"test\")"}}' | nc localhost 8000
```

## Success Criteria
