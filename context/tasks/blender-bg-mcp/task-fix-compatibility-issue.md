# ✅ TASK COMPLETED - BLD Remote MCP Compatibility Issue Fixed

**Status:** DONE  
**Completion Date:** 2025-01-09  
**Resolution:** All compatibility issues resolved successfully

## Original Issue Description

When `BlenderAutoMCP` is developed, it is intended as a drop-in replacement of the `blender-mcp` plugin (context/refcode/blender-mcp), so that `context/refcode/blender-mcp/src/blender_mcp/server.py` can communicate with the `BlenderAutoMCP` addon ('context/refcode/blender_auto_mcp/__init__.py') directly. In that sense, `BlenderAutoMCP` and `blender-mcp` has the exact same communication protocol that they can be used interchangably.

This is also a requirement for `BLD_Remote_MCP`, we expect LLMs like Gemini or Sonnet who can talk to the `blender-mcp` (`context/refcode/blender-mcp/src/blender_mcp/server.py`) can also directly talk to `BLD_Remote_MCP`, sending and receiving TCP messages from port 9876 via direct socket connection. Note that, we DO NOT need to support functions related to 3rd asset providers (`context/refcode/blender_auto_mcp/asset_providers.py`).

## Original Problems Encountered

### LLM Client Side Error:
```
Error getting scene info: Connection to Blender lost: [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer
```

### Blender Side Issue:
The logs showed that BLD Remote MCP was receiving commands like `get_polyhaven_status` but was falling back to legacy response format instead of proper command handling, and connections were being closed prematurely.

Original logs from Blender side:
```
[BLD Remote][INFO][23:23:30] NEW CLIENT CONNECTION from ('127.0.0.1', 40826) to ('127.0.0.1', 9876)

```

## ✅ RESOLUTION COMPLETED

### Issues Fixed:

1. **Missing Essential MCP Handlers** ✅
   - Added `get_viewport_screenshot` handler (was completely missing)
   - Proper BlenderAutoMCP-compatible command processing
   - Full parameter support and error handling

2. **Critical Code Execution Bug** ✅ 
   - Fixed Python import scoping issues in `execute_code`
   - Added `__builtins__` support for full Python environment
   - Resolved "name 'np' is not defined" errors in function scopes

3. **Command Protocol Compatibility** ✅
   - All essential BlenderAutoMCP handlers now implemented
   - Proper JSON command/response format matching expected interface
   - Compatible with LLM client expectations

### Technical Implementation:

#### Handler Coverage:
- ✅ `get_scene_info` - Scene information retrieval
- ✅ `get_object_info` - Object details and properties  
- ✅ `get_viewport_screenshot` - GUI viewport capture with background mode handling
- ✅ `execute_code` - Python code execution with proper scoping
- ✅ `server_shutdown` - Clean service termination
- ✅ `get_polyhaven_status` - Asset provider status (returns disabled)

#### Code Execution Environment Fix:
```python
# BEFORE (broken scoping):
exec_globals = {'bpy': bpy}
exec_locals = {}
exec(code, exec_globals, exec_locals)

# AFTER (fixed scoping):
exec_globals = {
    '__builtins__': __builtins__,
    'bpy': bpy,
}
exec(code, exec_globals, exec_globals)  # Same dict for proper scoping
```

#### Background Mode Handling:
```python
if _is_background_mode():
    raise ValueError("Viewport screenshots are not available in background mode (blender --background)")
```

### Testing Results:

#### LLM Client Compatibility:
- ✅ Complex numpy-based code execution works perfectly
- ✅ All essential MCP commands respond correctly with proper JSON format
- ✅ Protocol fully compatible with BlenderAutoMCP clients
- ✅ Proper error handling and status responses

#### Viewport Screenshots:
- ✅ GUI Mode: Successfully captures 400x228 screenshots, 44KB PNG files
- ✅ Background Mode: Clear error messages explaining GUI limitations

#### Original User Code:
- ❌ **Before:** `"name 'np' is not defined"` errors
- ✅ **After:** `{'status': 'success', 'result': {'message': 'Code executed successfully'}}`

### Files Modified:
- `blender_addon/bld_remote_mcp/__init__.py` - Core implementation fixes
  - Added `get_viewport_screenshot()` function (lines 165-238)
  - Added viewport screenshot command handler (lines 369-375)
  - Fixed `execute_code()` scoping (lines 150-166)
  - Fixed legacy code execution scoping (lines 423-430)
- Comprehensive test suite added for validation
- Documentation updated with background mode guidance

### Documentation:
- **Complete log:** `context/logs/2025-01-09_bld-remote-mcp-code-execution-fix-success.md`
- **Commit:** `f5cab50` - All changes committed successfully
- **Changed files:** 9 files, 1,396 insertions, 21 deletions

## Current Status

BLD Remote MCP now provides **full compatibility** with BlenderAutoMCP for LLM clients:
- ✅ All essential MCP handlers implemented
- ✅ Proper command/response protocol matching BlenderAutoMCP interface
- ✅ Background mode compatibility with clear error messages
- ✅ Complex Python code execution support (numpy, mathutils, etc.)
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging

The service can now be used as a **drop-in replacement** for BlenderAutoMCP by LLM clients expecting the standard MCP command interface. All original compatibility issues have been resolved.
