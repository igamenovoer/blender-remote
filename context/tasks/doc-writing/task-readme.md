here is how you should write the README.md.

The case in this template does not matter, you decide the case based on style.

The guide should cover both linux and Windows (using powershell) usage.

For windows, we assume the user has installed Python using chocolatey, and the `blender-remote-cli` is installed using pip.


# project title

## Overview

- purpose of the project
- to help these intended users:
- - who wants to do complicated Blender tasks, but do not have time to learn Blender Python API, and feel uncomfortable to write Blender-side python code within Blender's barebone text editor.
- - who heavily relies on LLMs to write code, and wants to automate Blender tasks.
- outline our solution:
- - provide a way to use LLMs to generate Blender-side python code, and wrap it into Python API, so that users can use their preferred IDEs to develop Python tools for Blender.
- - provide a way to run Blender in background mode, so that users can automate Blender tasks.
- - emphasize that, we DO NOT try to map all blender python API to python or MCP, but rather provide a way to allow the user to develop their own python tools to interact with Blender, with the help of LLMs. As such, the project is built upon the idea that to simultaneously allow LLM and python client to interact with Blender, smoothing the transition between LLM-generated blender-side python code and user-written external python code, so that user can just wrap the LLM-generated code into python api, possible also using LLM to generate the wrapper code.

- introduce the system architecture
- - we have a blender addon, using json-rpc to communicate with external caller like mcp server and python client. name this addon as `BLD_Remote_MCP`
- - we have a MCP server, which communicates with the Blender addon and external LLM IDEs like VSCode, it accepts standard MCP commands and forwards them to the Blender addon. 
- - we have a Python client, which can be used to control Blender remotely using the addon directly, bypassing the MCP server.
- - show the system architecture diagram

- main features
- - seamless bridges between LLM-generated Blender-side python code and user-written external python code
- - support background mode for full automation and batch processing
- supports windows/linux/macOS, but macOS is not well tested yet, so use at your own risk.

- caution: code is mainly written with the help of AI assistants, use at your own risk.

## Usage

### Installation

how to install the project, from source code and from `pip`

how to install `uv` because we need `uvx` to run the MCP server

### Basic Usage

#### The CLI approach
mainly introduce how to use `blender-remote-cli` to initialize the plugin and install the addon in Blender.

- how to use `blender-remote-cli` to initialize the project and install the addon. Note that, mention how to verify the installation is successful in GUI.
- how to use `blender-remote-cli` to start blender in GUI and background mode
- - mention that in GUI mode, user can use `bld_remote` module to interact with the MCP server, check status.
- how to use `blender-remote-cli start` to execute commands over a running Blender instance, and with specific port.
- how to use `blender-remote-cli` to configure port and other settings.

#### The MCP server approach
this is mainly for using the MCP server with LLM IDEs like VSCode.
Note that user should use CLI to install blender addon first, see the previous section.

- how to use `uvx` to install the MCP server, give configuration example in vscode
- - how to specify the blender port and host in `uvx` command, it must match the port used in the `blender-remote-cli start` command, for host, it is the blender host's ip address.

#### The Python client approach
this is mainly for using the blender addon with Python scripts, in external environments not within Blender, controlling Blender remotely.

- how to use `BlenderMCPClient` to connect to the blender addon, and execute python codes.
- how to use `BlenderSceneManager` to manage Blender scenes and objects. The scene manager mainly serves as an example as to how to use the client api with the help of LLM generating blender-side python code.

### Advanced Usage

#### using LLM to develop Python tools for Blender
- how to use LLMs to generate Blender-side python code, and how to wrap them into Python API using the `BlenderMCPClient`, still using LLMs to generate the wrapper code. give a possible example, with talks between user and LLM (you make it up, but it should be realistic, be basic and easy to understand).

#### batch processing using blender background mode
- how to use `blender-remote-cli` to run Blender in background mode, and use python client api to execute batch processing tasks, and using python client api to exit Blender gracefully.
