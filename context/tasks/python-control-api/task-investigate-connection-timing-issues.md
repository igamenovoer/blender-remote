# Task: Investigate Python Control API Connection Timing Issues

## Overview

During implementation and testing of the Python Control API, we've encountered intermittent connection issues with the BLD Remote MCP service when making rapid sequential calls. This task documents the issue and provides a roadmap for investigation.

## Issue Description

### Symptoms
- **Test Pattern**: `test_basic_connection` PASSES, but subsequent `test_scene_info` FAILS
- **Error Message**: `Connection closed before receiving any data`
- **Timing**: Issue occurs after successful initial connection test
- **Consistency**: Raw socket tests work when run individually, but fail in rapid succession

### What Works ✅
1. **Single connections**: Individual calls to `get_scene_info()` work perfectly
2. **Python execution**: `execute_python()` commands work consistently  
3. **Raw socket tests**: Direct socket communication works when isolated
4. **Basic functionality**: All core API operations work when given proper timing

### What Fails ❌
1. **Sequential connections**: Multiple `get_scene_info()` calls from different client instances
2. **Rapid succession**: Quick consecutive calls to the same command type
3. **Test sequences**: Automated test suites that make multiple API calls

## Technical Analysis

### Connection Pattern Investigation

**Successful Pattern:**
```python
# This works
client = BlenderMCPClient(port=6688)
result = client.test_connection()  # Calls get_scene_info() internally
# Returns: True
```

**Failing Pattern:**
```python
# First call works
client1 = BlenderMCPClient(port=6688) 
status = client1.get_status()  # Success

# Second call fails
client2 = BlenderMCPClient(port=6688)
scene_info = client2.get_scene_info()  # ConnectionError: Connection closed before receiving any data
```

### Evidence Collected

1. **Raw Socket Tests**: Direct socket connections work individually:
   ```bash
   pixi run python tests/python_control_api/debug_connection.py
   # Results: get_scene_info=PASS, execute_code=PASS
   ```

2. **Client Debug Tests**: Shows pattern-specific failures:
   ```bash
   pixi run python tests/python_control_api/debug_client_sequence.py
   # Single calls: PASS
   # Sequence calls: PASS  
   # Multiple execute_python: FAIL (3rd call fails)
   ```

3. **Service Response**: BLD Remote MCP service responds correctly to individual requests
   - Port 6688 is listening: `tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:6688 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 103722/blender`
   - Service responds with valid JSON: `{"status": "success", "result": {...}}`

### Root Cause Hypotheses

#### Hypothesis 1: Service Connection Limits
- **Theory**: BLD Remote MCP service may have a connection limit or rate limiting
- **Evidence**: Works individually but fails in succession
- **Test**: Check if service logs show connection rejections

#### Hypothesis 2: Resource Cleanup Issues  
- **Theory**: Service may not properly clean up connections, leading to resource exhaustion
- **Evidence**: Pattern suggests accumulating resource usage
- **Test**: Monitor service resource usage during rapid connections

#### Hypothesis 3: Socket Reuse Issues
- **Theory**: TCP socket reuse or TIME_WAIT state conflicts
- **Evidence**: Each client creates new socket connections
- **Test**: Add SO_REUSEADDR or connection pooling

#### Hypothesis 4: Service Threading/Async Issues
- **Theory**: Service may not handle concurrent or rapid sequential requests properly
- **Evidence**: Single-threaded access works, multi-access fails
- **Test**: Add delays between requests, test with single persistent connection

## Impact Assessment

### Current Status
- **API Implementation**: ✅ COMPLETE - all core functionality implemented
- **Basic Operations**: ✅ WORKING - individual API calls work correctly
- **Integration Testing**: ⚠️ PARTIAL - 4/5 integration tests pass
- **Production Readiness**: ⚠️ NEEDS INVESTIGATION - timing issues could affect reliability

### User Impact
- **Individual Operations**: No impact - single API calls work perfectly
- **Automated Scripts**: May need to add delays between operations
- **Integration Tools**: Should implement connection pooling or retry logic

## Investigation Plan

### Phase 1: Service Analysis (High Priority)
1. **Monitor BLD Remote MCP Service**:
   - Check Blender console for error messages during test failures
   - Monitor service resource usage (memory, file descriptors)
   - Enable debug logging in BLD Remote MCP service if available

2. **Connection Behavior Analysis**:
   - Test with SO_REUSEADDR socket option
   - Implement connection pooling in client
   - Add configurable delays between requests

### Phase 2: Client Optimization (Medium Priority)
1. **Connection Management**:
   - Implement persistent connection option
   - Add connection retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Pool connections for multiple operations

2. **Error Recovery**:
   - Enhance error handling for connection timing issues
   - Add automatic retry for "Connection closed" errors
   - Implement graceful degradation

### Phase 3: Service Enhancement (Low Priority)
1. **BLD Remote MCP Service Investigation**:
   - Review service architecture for connection handling
   - Check for threading/async issues in service code
   - Consider service-side connection pooling

2. **Protocol Optimization**:
   - Investigate persistent connection protocols
   - Consider batching multiple operations in single request

## Workarounds

### Current Workarounds
1. **Add Delays**: Insert `time.sleep(1)` between operations
2. **Single Client**: Reuse same client instance for multiple operations
3. **Retry Logic**: Implement automatic retry on connection failures

### Implementation Example
```python
import time
import blender_remote

def robust_scene_operation():
    """Example of robust operation with timing consideration."""
    client = blender_remote.connect_to_blender(port=6688)
    
    try:
        # First operation
        scene_info = client.get_scene_info()
        time.sleep(0.5)  # Brief delay
        
        # Second operation
        result = client.execute_python("print('Hello')")
        
        return scene_info, result
    except blender_remote.BlenderConnectionError:
        # Retry once with longer delay
        time.sleep(2)
        return robust_scene_operation()
```

## Testing Protocol

### Reproduction Steps
1. Start Blender with BLD Remote MCP service on port 6688
2. Run: `pixi run python tests/python_control_api/test_basic_connection.py`
3. Observe: First test passes, second test fails with connection error

### Debugging Commands
```bash
# Check service status
netstat -tlnp | grep 6688

# Run individual debug tests
pixi run python tests/python_control_api/debug_connection.py
pixi run python tests/python_control_api/debug_client_sequence.py

# Monitor Blender console during tests
# (Look for connection errors or resource warnings)
```

## Success Criteria

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Understand root cause of connection timing issues
- [ ] Implement reliable solution (retry logic, connection pooling, or service fix)
- [ ] All integration tests pass consistently (5/5)
- [ ] API works reliably in automated scripts without manual delays

### Acceptance Tests
1. **Rapid Sequential Test**: 10 consecutive API calls complete successfully
2. **Integration Test Suite**: All tests pass without manual delays
3. **Stress Test**: 100 operations complete without connection failures
4. **Multi-Client Test**: Multiple client instances can operate simultaneously

## Priority and Timeline

- **Priority**: Medium (API is functional, issue affects reliability)
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-4 hours investigation + implementation
- **Dependencies**: Access to BLD Remote MCP service logs/debugging
- **Blocking**: Not blocking for basic API usage, affects automation reliability
