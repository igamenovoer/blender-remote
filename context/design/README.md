# Design

This directory contains API and technical design documentation.

## Purpose

Store design documents that define how the system should work before implementation begins:

- API specifications and interface designs
- System architecture diagrams and explanations
- Technical design decisions and rationales
- Data models and schema definitions
- Protocol specifications
- Integration patterns

## Content Types

### API Design
- Endpoint specifications and request/response formats
- Method signatures and parameter definitions
- Authentication and authorization schemes
- Error handling patterns

### Technical Architecture
- System component diagrams
- Data flow descriptions
- Security considerations
- Performance requirements
- Scalability plans

### Design Decisions
- Technology choices and alternatives considered
- Trade-offs analysis
- Constraints and limitations
- Future extensibility considerations

## File Organization

Name files descriptively with version indicators when needed:
- `api_v1_specification.md`
- `authentication_design.md`
- `data_model_overview.md`
- `system_architecture.md`

## Usage

Before implementing new features:
1. Check if design documentation exists
2. Create or update design documents as needed
3. Review with team/stakeholders before coding
4. Keep designs updated as implementation evolves

Design documents should be created before major implementation work begins and updated when significant changes are made to the system.
